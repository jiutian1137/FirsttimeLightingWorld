Èze has been described as an “eagle’s nest” because of its location overlooking a high cliff 427
metres (1,401 ft) above sea level on the French Mediterranean. It is so high that the light ochre
church within (Notre Dame de l’Assomption built in 1764) can be seen from afar. An Egyptian cross
inside the church suggests the village’s ancient roots, when the Phoenicians erected a temple there 
to honour the goddess Isis - Wikipedia

Friedrich Nietzsche stayed in one of the oldest houses of Eze and found inspiration for his third part 
of “Thus spake Zarathoustra” while climbing to the village by the path. “Many hidden corners and 
quiets heights in the landscape of Nice were sanctified for me by unforgettable moments” said 
Frederic Nieztsche in Ecce homo about his first stay on the Riviera from the December 2nd, 1883 to 
April 20th, 1884 - Èze Tourism
